## Introduction

Duplicate questions can clutter a Q&A platform and make it difficult for users to find unique answers. This project tackles this issue by identifying duplicate questions using various machine learning models and natural language processing techniques.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/koushik-yarra/duplicate_questions_project.git
    cd duplicate_questions_project
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

You can use the Jupyter Notebooks provided in this repository to train and evaluate models for detecting duplicate questions. Open the notebooks in your Jupyter environment and follow the instructions provided in each notebook.
